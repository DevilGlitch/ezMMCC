# ezMMCC
> Minecraft Mod Compatibility Checker<br><br>
> Very simplistic mod checker basically just runs through which mods have conflicting changes in classes than compiles them than writes them to a file in which you can figure out which mods work and which don't
<br>
ezMMCC is prone to hit false positives if you get exit code 1 while launching minecraft this is a great tool to figure out which mods are acting up.
<br>

## New Install and Usage ( Gui & Auto Detect )
Run GUI_Install.bat or run ezMMCC.exe may get flagged as a virus because of pyinstaller.<br><br>
Need to have python installed for the GUI_Install.bat <br><br>
As of rn Auto Detect only works for CurseForge packs and Modrith add any more you want in the issues<br>
<br>
To use the manual just select whatever folder the mods are in.
<br><br>

## Depreciated Downlaod And Useage ( NO GUI )
just drag the old python / batch file into the mod folder and run it
